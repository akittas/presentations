    "\n",
    ">Metaprogramming is a technique of writing computer programs that can treat themselves as data, so you can introspect, generate, and/or modify them while running\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python has the ability to introspect its basic elements such as functions, classes, or types and to create or modify them on the fly.\n",
    "- Higher order functions allow us to add/modify functionality of existing functions, methods, or classes.\n",
    "- Special methods of classes that allow us to interfere with the creation of class objects. These are called **Metaclasses** and allow us to even completely redesign the Python's object-oriented paradigm. \n",
    "- A selection of different tools that allow programmers to work directly with code either in its raw plain text format or in the more programmatically accessible **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** form. This approach is allows for really extraordinary things, such as extending Python's language syntax or even creating your own Domain Specific Language (DSL), see e.g. [Hy](https://github.com/hylang/hy)."
